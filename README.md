### Clearing RAM Cache on Linux Servers

# Overview
- RAM cache is used by the Linux kernel to store frequently accessed disk data in memory, improving performance by reducing disk I/O. However, over time, cached memory can grow large and sometimes lead to situations where free memory is low, 
  which can impact performance in certain scenarios.
- Clearing the RAM cache manually can help reclaim memory resources when needed, such as before running memory-intensive applications or troubleshooting memory usage issues.

# How to Clear RAM Cache
1. Create a Script to Clear Cache
Create a shell script named clear_ram_cache.sh:
    #!/bin/bash

# Flush file system buffers to disk
    sync

# Clear pagecache, dentries, and inodes
    echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches > /dev/null

2. Make the Script Executable
chmod +x clear_ram_cache.sh

3. Run the Script with Root Privileges
sudo ./clear_ram_cache.sh

Automating Cache Clearing with Cron

To automatically clear RAM cache every 30 minutes, add a cron job:
  1. Edit the root crontab:
    
    sudo crontab -e

  2. Add the following line:

    */30 * * * * /path/to/clear_ram_cache.sh

    
- Replace /path/to/clear_ram_cache.sh with the full path to your script.

### Why Clear RAM Cache?

- Benefits
    • Free Up Memory for Critical Applications
- Clearing cache can free memory immediately for applications that need it, improving performance under heavy load.
    • Resolve Memory Pressure Issues
- Helps prevent out-of-memory (OOM) situations when the system is low on free memory.
    • Improve System Stability
- Occasionally clearing caches can reduce the risk of system slowdown caused by excessive cached data.
    • Useful During Testing and Troubleshooting
- Developers and system admins can clear cache to better understand real memory usage or before performance testing.

### Important Notes

  • Clearing the cache temporarily frees memory, but Linux will cache files again as needed.
  • Cache is usually beneficial for performance, so clearing it frequently without reason may degrade performance.
  • Writing to /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches requires root privileges.
  • Use caution when scheduling automatic cache clearing to avoid disrupting normal system behavior.

### Troubleshooting: Sudo Permissions

If running the script fails due to permission issues, you may need to adjust sudo permissions:
    1. Open the sudoers file safely using:
    
    sudo visudo
    
   2. Add the following line (replace username with your actual user):
      
    username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
    
  3. Modify the script to use sudo tee as shown earlier:

    echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches > /dev/null
    
- This allows the user to execute the command without entering a password, which is useful for automated scripts.

- If you need further assistance with permissions, cron setup, or scripting, just ask!
